 I am a first year PhD student at the UtahArch lab at the University of Utah. Prior to this, I was an integrated master student at the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore.        
        I am a researcher specializing in processing-in-memory computing architectures.
        My current focus is on developing energy-efficient microarchitecture designs that can be integrated seamlessly with traditional memory technologies. 
By bringing computation closer to memory, I aim to address the ever-growing performance gap between processors and memory.
