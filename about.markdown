 I am a first-year PhD student in the UtahArch Lab at the University of Utah, working under Prof. Rajeev Balasubramonian. My research focuses on processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies within computer architecture. Specifically, I aim to design innovative architectural solutions that integrate memory and processing elements to enhance system efficiency, optimize performance, and reduce energy consumption.

Currently, I am developing a PIM architecture for general-purpose applications and benchmarking it against state-of-the-art PIM designs. By bringing computation closer to memory, I aim to address the ever-growing performance gap between processors and memory. Prior to my PhD, I completed an integrated master's program at the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, where I specialized in computer architecture and microarchitecture design.

My work is driven by a commitment to advancing energy-efficient microarchitectures that can seamlessly integrate with traditional memory technologies, bridging the divide between computation and memory for next-generation computing systems.
