 <p>I am a first-year PhD student in the UtahArch Lab at the University of Utah, working under <a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/" target="_blank">Prof. Rajeev Balasubramonian</a>. My research focuses on processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies within computer architecture. Specifically, I aim to design innovative architectural solutions that integrate memory and processing elements to enhance system efficiency, optimize performance, and reduce energy consumption.</p>
<p> Prior to my PhD, I completed an integrated master's program at the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, where I specialized in computer architecture and microarchitecture design.</p>
<p>I am currently seeking <strong>summer internship opportunities for 2025</strong> in the field of hardware accelerators and micro-architecture design. With a strong background in <strong>energy-efficient computing systems</strong>, <strong>micro-architecture design</strong>, and <strong>processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures</strong>, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion for innovation to impactful projects.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me if you believe my profile aligns with any active roles relevant to my areas of expertise. I am looking forward to exploring new challenges and making meaningful contributions. Please refer to my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Dm3w-x4hNVAglailYhgC3nQuvxmol9-/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CV</a> for further details.</p>
