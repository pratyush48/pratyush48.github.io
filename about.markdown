 I am a first-year PhD student in the UtahArch Lab at the University of Utah, working under <a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/" target="_blank">Prof. Rajeev Balasubramonian</a>. My research focuses on processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies within computer architecture. Specifically, I aim to design innovative architectural solutions that integrate memory and processing elements to enhance system efficiency, optimize performance, and reduce energy consumption.

I am currently seeking **summer internship opportunities for 2025** in the field of hardware accelerators and micro-architecture design. With a strong background in **energy-efficient computing systems**, **micro-architecture design**, and **processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures**, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion for innovation to impactful projects.

Feel free to contact me if you believe my profile aligns with any active roles relevant to my areas of expertise. I am looking forward to exploring new challenges and making meaningful contributions. Please refer to my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Dm3w-x4hNVAglailYhgC3nQuvxmol9-/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CV</a> for further details.

 Prior to my PhD, I completed an integrated master's program at the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore, where I specialized in computer architecture and microarchitecture design.
